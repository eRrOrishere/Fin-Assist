# Fin-Assist

## Our understanding of the challenge

Today, many people are unable to meet their financial goals and have weak family's
financial security because of poor analyzation of financial spends across various bank
accounts.
This is because of the lack of required financial knowledge and experience.
In India, 26 % of the population is illiterate, 28.5 % is below the poverty line and one-third
lives in rural India, they are highly vulnerable to weak family’s financial security, low cash
flow, high-risk tolerance.
Due to the lack of availability of CFP /CFA /ChFC/ RIA certified advisors in a particular
area, consumers are unable to get the required assistance.

## Proposed Solution

To build an App Finassist that will provide the following functionalities:
Analyze consumer financial spends across various bank accounts : Saving and spending scenario with deep
insights
Financial assistance: Provide assistance and suggestions to consumer in all financial spends and investments.
Fin-Education: educating consumers about financial terms, process, bank key concepts, etc.
Accountable personal financial advisor: well educated, credentialed, experienced, financial professionals list will
be provided. Depending upon their requirements, consumers can select the advisor.
Updated information: Consumers will be provided with the updated information about their bank accounts, plans,
bank and government schemes, etc.
Smart contracts: help consumers to have smart contracts to achieve financial goals.
This solution will effectively reduce unfocused and poor financial planning. This will help consumers to effectively manage
their income and increase savings.

### The objectives of the proposed solution are:

1. To financially assist consumer to meet financial goals.
2. To increase consumers family’s financial security.

reaching substantiated conclusions.
2. Communication: communicate effectively on complex financial activities with the
advisory community.
3. Life-long learning: Recognize the need for, and have the preparation and the ability to

scenario.

## Risk, Issues and Mitigation plan

1. Incorrect analysis : this can be arised due to incorrect information and outdated
information entered. Consumer has to make sure all the information provided is up to the
date.
2. Time horizon: Suggestions provided may get delayed due some technical and advisors
personal reasons. Therefore , consumers need to understand and take step carefully.
3. Payment security risk : payment security is the most important area of concern for
consumer . Incorrect payment details or technical problem can cause unwanted money
